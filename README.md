# food-place-economy

A model of the economy in the food service industry to practice inheritance and polymorphism.

We model places where customers can buy food: restaurants, food stands, and fast food. 
We model the payment of bills, including sales tax and tip. 
We model a tax collector who collects both sales tax and income tax.
